Repository storing work toward detecting human activity states. Includes several tutorials I've found useful.

## Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
HAR focuses on detecting the probable activity that a human is performing from either a static image or a set of images in squence.<br>
<br
A HAR application is commonly divided into three stages:<br>
<ol>
<li>Detection of the human object</li>
<li>detection of the human object's atamony or interest points *(used to determine the activity)*</li>
<li>prediction of the activity based on the provided data/li>
</ol>

Additional points of interest for research include the continuing squence of actions, next probable actions, actions as part of a group, detecting group behavior and many more.<br>
